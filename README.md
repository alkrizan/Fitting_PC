# Fitting_PC
Script for fitting C 1s spectra (XPS) of propylene carbonate (PC). The script determines the position of the spectra on the kinetic energy scale. A reference C 1s spectrum of PC is used as the input and the kinetic energy of C 1s is determined by finding the best match between the reference spectrum and the experimental data. The current form of the code is especially suitable for fitting PC spectra recorded with ambient pressure XPS where beam damage irradiation produces unknown species distorting the experimental data close to C-O and C-C/C-H peak. The beam damage issue is circumvented by assessing the match between the reference and the experimental spectrum solely in proximity of the C=O peak. The script was used in paper DOI:
